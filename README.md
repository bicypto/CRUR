CRUR Simplified UI
===================

Intro
-----
Original CRUR spec is available --> https://github.com/Cryptoruble/CRUR 

Please note that total CRUR supply in over 5300000000 (5,3 Bn). Most of coins were premined or staked to address 629do7rQdRaQXTnJaQDK6EGbwdTymkfMmL (~5 Bn). There is no exchange for CRUR. CRUR were originally listed to Cryptopia exchange but CRUR delisted from Cryptopia at spring 2018. It seems that there is no any active development to CRUR. Anyway CRUR blockchain is still up and running. There is ~3-9 connections available when wallet is open and synching.

New UI
------
CRUR Simplified UI is only a new UI (picture below). No any other changes. This is just my own testing to see if source code can be compiled to exe file (windows). After few hours i was able to create a new modified UI and it is working. Exe (windows) file can be found under releases (v1.2.2.0 Pre-release). please note that also original source code can be compiled. It is also possible to create a deamon (CRURd). I have tested CRURd in a linux environment (Ubuntu). Deamon can be found under src folder (make -f makefile.unix) but 1st you have to install all dependies.

CRUR explorer can be easily created based on open source explorer Iquidus --> https://github.com/iquidus/explorer
I have tested this succesfully. See below top6 addresses after few thousands blocks.
